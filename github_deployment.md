# GitHub Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the One Beyond All Crypto Trading Bot to GitHub and ensuring it runs properly with GitHub integration.

## Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account
2. Git installed on your local machine
3. Basic knowledge of Git commands

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "one-beyond-all-trading-bot")
4. Choose visibility (public or private)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Initialize Git in Your Project

```bash
cd /path/to/crypto_trading_bot
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 3. Connect to GitHub Repository

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/one-beyond-all-trading-bot.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

Create a `.github/workflows` directory and add a YAML file for automated testing:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

Create a file named `.github/workflows/test.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Test Trading Bot

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        python -m unittest discover
```

### 5. GitHub Integration Features

#### GitHub Pages for Documentation

You can use GitHub Pages to host your bot's documentation:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
3. Select the branch to use (e.g., main)
4. Choose the folder (e.g., /docs)
5. Click "Save"

Create a `/docs` folder in your repository with documentation files.

#### GitHub Issues for Bug Tracking

Enable GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Make sure the "Issues" feature is enabled
3. Create issue templates for bug reports and feature requests

#### GitHub Releases for Version Management

Create releases for stable versions of your bot:

1. Go to the "Releases" section of your repository
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Tag the version (e.g., v1.0.0)
4. Add release notes
5. Attach the ZIP file of your bot
6. Publish the release

## Best Practices for GitHub Integration

1. **Use Semantic Versioning**: Follow the X.Y.Z format where X is major version, Y is minor version, and Z is patch version.

2. **Create a Detailed README.md**: Include installation instructions, usage examples, and screenshots.

3. **Add a LICENSE File**: Choose an appropriate license for your project.

4. **Set Up a .gitignore File**: Exclude unnecessary files like __pycache__, .env, and other sensitive or temporary files.

5. **Use Pull Requests**: Make changes in feature branches and use pull requests to merge them into the main branch.

6. **Continuous Integration**: Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

7. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date with each release.

## Troubleshooting GitHub Integration

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Push Rejected**: If your push is rejected, try pulling first to merge remote changes:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase origin main
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Large Files**: GitHub has a file size limit of 100MB. For larger files, use Git LFS:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.model" # Track large model files
   git add .gitattributes
   ```

3. **Authentication Issues**: If you're having authentication issues, use a personal access token or SSH key.

4. **Merge Conflicts**: Resolve merge conflicts by editing the conflicted files, then:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   git commit
   ```

## Keeping Your GitHub Repository Updated

Regularly update your repository with new features and bug fixes:

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

Create a new release when you have significant updates:

1. Update the version number in your code
2. Create a new tag and release on GitHub
3. Include detailed release notes

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you'll have a well-structured GitHub repository for your One Beyond All Crypto Trading Bot, making it easy to collaborate, track issues, and manage versions.
